<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In this project, we learnt and got a full grasp and understanding of Testing Driven Development and how to use it in JavaScript. The main idea is simply that we start working on our code by writing automated tests before writing the code that is being tested.

We also made use of the Jest Testing-running system for this project and this is because Jest has great resources for explaining JavaScript testing and has fantastic documentation as well.

We built the following functions/objects and their test suites. We ensured that the methods pass their automated tests.

- capitalize(string) -> a function that takes a string and returns that string with the first character capitalized.
- reverseString(string) -> a function that takes a string and returns it reversed.
- caesarCipher -> a function that encrypts and decrypts strings.
- calculator  -> an object that contains the basic operations: add, subtract, divide, and multiply.
- analysis -> a function that takes an array of numbers and returns an object with the following properties: average, min, max, and length.
